# Week-8-473
This is the eights  week of my violet python class

This Assignment captures network traffic and displays the data in a pretty table format. Users should create network traffic by accessing popular websites to ensure there's data to capture and display.

## Enhancements

This project includes enhancements such as:
- GUI for initial user input using Tkinter.
- Additional columns in the PrettyTable to display more detailed information about each packet.
- Improved filtering options to target specific types of traffic.
